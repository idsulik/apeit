        <h1>Lesson 6: Precognition (Thinking Step by Step)</h1>
        
        <p>"Precognition" in prompt engineering means asking Claude to think through problems step-by-step before providing the final answer. This technique dramatically improves reasoning quality and accuracy.</p>

        <h2>üß† What is Precognition?</h2>
        
        <p>Precognition involves explicitly asking Claude to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Show its reasoning process</li>
            <li>Break down complex problems into steps</li>
            <li>Consider multiple angles before concluding</li>
            <li>Verify its own thinking</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> When Claude "thinks out loud," it catches errors, considers more possibilities, and provides more thorough, accurate responses.</p>
