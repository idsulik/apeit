        <h1>Lesson 3: Assigning Roles (Role Prompting)</h1>
        
        <p>Role prompting is a powerful technique where you assign Claude a specific role, persona, or expertise area. This helps Claude respond with the appropriate knowledge, tone, and perspective for your needs.</p>

        <h2>üé≠ What is Role Prompting?</h2>
        
        <p>Role prompting means telling Claude to act as a specific type of expert, professional, or character. This primes Claude to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use domain-specific knowledge and terminology</li>
            <li>Adopt appropriate tone and communication style</li>
            <li>Apply relevant frameworks and methodologies</li>
            <li>Consider context from that role's perspective</li>
        </ul>
