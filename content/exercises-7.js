        solution: `Analyze business decisions with step-by-step reasoning:

Example 1:
Decision: "Should a restaurant add delivery service?"
Analysis:
Step 1: Market demand - Many customers request delivery, competitors offer it
Step 2: Costs - Delivery platform fees (20-30%), need delivery staff or third-party
Step 3: Revenue potential - Could increase sales by 25-40% based on industry data
Step 4: Operational impact - Kitchen may need to handle higher volume, packaging costs
Step 5: Competition - Not offering delivery means losing customers to competitors
Conclusion: Yes, implement delivery. Revenue increase likely outweighs costs and keeps business competitive.

Example 2:
Decision: "Should a boutique expand to a second location?"
Analysis:
Step 1: Current performance - First location profitable for 2+ years, strong customer base
Step 2: Market research - Identified underserved area with target demographic
Step 3: Financial capacity - Have sufficient capital for 6-month runway
Step 4: Management bandwidth - Owner can oversee both locations initially
Step 5: Risk assessment - Second location reduces dependency on single location
Conclusion: Yes, expand. Strong foundation and identified opportunity justify expansion risk.
