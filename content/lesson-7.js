        <h1>Lesson 7: Using Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)</h1>
        
        <p>Few-shot prompting is one of the most powerful techniques in prompt engineering. By providing examples of the desired input-output pattern, you can guide Claude to understand exactly what you want, even for complex or nuanced tasks.</p>

        <h2>üéØ What is Few-Shot Prompting?</h2>
        
        <p>Few-shot prompting means providing a few examples of the task you want Claude to perform, showing both the input and the expected output. This helps Claude understand:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The exact format you want</li>
            <li>The style and tone to use</li>
            <li>The level of detail expected</li>
            <li>How to handle edge cases</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><strong>Why examples work:</strong> Humans learn by example, and so do AI models. Examples provide concrete patterns that are often clearer than abstract instructions.</p>

                <pre>Solve math word problems by showing your reasoning:

Example 1:
Problem: "A store offers 20% off, then an additional 10% off the discounted price. What's the final price of a $100 item?"
Solution: 
Step 1: Apply first discount: $100 √ó 0.8 = $80
Step 2: Apply second discount: $80 √ó 0.9 = $72
Answer: $72

Example 2:

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>üéØ Choosing the Right Number of Examples</h2>

        <div class="component-box">
            <h3>One-Shot (1 example)</h3>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Use when:</strong> Simple, straightforward tasks with clear patterns
                <br><strong>Example:</strong> Basic format conversion, simple classification
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="example">
                <strong>Use when:</strong> Most complex tasks requiring nuance and style
                <br><strong>Example:</strong> Creative writing, analysis, complex formatting
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="component-box">
            <h3>Many-Shot (5+ examples)</h3>
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Use when:</strong> Highly specific tasks or when dealing with many edge cases
                <br><strong>Example:</strong> Specialized data extraction, complex classification with many categories
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>üîÑ Combining Few-Shot with Other Techniques</h2>

        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
<strong>Few-Shot + Role Prompting:</strong>
"As a professional copywriter, write product descriptions following these examples..."

<strong>Few-Shot + Step-by-Step:</strong>
"Analyze these problems step by step, following the pattern shown in these examples..."

<strong>Few-Shot + Output Formatting:</strong>
"Extract data in JSON format, as shown in these examples..."
            </pre>
